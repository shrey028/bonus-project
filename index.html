    <h1>Biography</h1>

    <h2>Favourite Car (Genesis G80)</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favourite car is the Genesis G80. The exterior is sleek, whereas the
      interior is too futuristic for its generation. The reason why this car is
      my favourite is because of its simplicity, potential, and its unique
      interior.

    <h2>Favourite Food (Pizza)</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favourite dish is pizza. As a kid, I have always loved pizza which is
      why it is still my favourite dish. The perfect twist between a fluffy
      crust, tangy sauce, and a lavish helping of some mozzarella cheese makes
      this dish a tasty delicacy.

    <h2>Favourite TV Show (The Office)</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favourite TV show is The Office. Being the first show I watched, I was
      hooked all through the 9 seasons of comedy. This show is heard about
      worldwide, by the iconic characters and humour. A subtle sitcom, but a
      chaotic masterpiece.

    <h2>Favourite Travel Destination (Dubai)</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favourite travel destination is Dubai. The reason why I pick it as my
      favourite travel destination is because of its unique aspects; futuristic
      look, tropical climate, tourist attraction. As part of my bucket list, I
      have experienced the city, mesmerized by its sceneries and intrigued on
      what new contributions it has to the world.
    </p>

    <h2>Favourite Movie (The Dark Knight)</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My favourite movie is The Dark Knight. In this super fictional journey
      about Gotham's Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan delivers a masterpiece. The
      fictional aspect of this movie is blended in with the reality of
      crime-inflicted cities, allowing chances to relate to the characters.

    <h2>Future Aspirations (Software Engineering)</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I aspire to become a software engineer in the future. I enjoy diving into
      the depths of how technology works and interpreting the process of each
      individual component in creating a stream of technology. As the way things
      are moving with technology, it holds an important aspect to our future and
      in creating a new environment.

    <h2>Hobbies (Drawing)</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      One of my hobbies is drawing. Whenever I draw, I feel relaxed. It helps me
      to take my mind off stress-inducing parts of my day. One thing about
      drawing is that once you lose focus, you lose momentum, which is why I am
      drawn to be focused and concentrated when drawing.
    </p>

    <h2>Favourite Sport (Badminton)</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The sport I enjoy playing the most is badminton. Out of all sports, I find
      badminton the most comforting and the one that I have the most experience
      in. As a kid, I have always loved challenging my sister to badminton, and
      I continue to challenge her and my friends as well. I strive to get better
      and play in a club one day.
    </p>

    <h2>Travelling Bucket List (Paris)</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I want to explore new countries and indulge completely in their cultures.
      Sharing new stories and experiences plays a role in my identity, as I love
      to explore. I want to travel to Paris in the future. I've been wanting to
      explore this romantic destination, because the scenery and atmosphere in
      Paris is worth wanting to explore.

    <h2>Positive Influences (Family)</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My family has always guided me in the right direction. Being one of the
      most important people in my life, I am grateful to have a family that
      cares about their son's pursuits and goals. My parents always give me full
      support and motivation, unless it's a step in the wrong direction, my
      parents will push me to accomplish my dreams and goals.

    <h1>Journal Entries</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      My culture is one of the major aspects of my identity. It's represented by
      the many stories that make it a whole. My culture is one of the main
      reasons how people look at me and what stories I have to tell to others.
      As an Indian, I celebrate a lot of festivals and respect traditions
      including the many aspects of my religion. For example, I celebrate Diwali
      and I was lucky enough to represent my culture when our school hosted its
      own Diwali event. It's an honor to proudly represent my culture to others
      and share its stories to others as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      My daily routine describes what I am like. In the morning, I usually have
      an hour or two to get ready, and it usually passes mostly through forcing
      myself to wake up due to the constant failed attempts to sleep on time.
      Then, I head on to school and focus on learning. Once school ends, I try
      heading to YMCA to exercise and relax from the workload of the day. Once I
      am fully relieved, I head home and spend time with my family because I
      don't get much time with them. My bedtime routine is quite simple as I
      fall asleep fast.
